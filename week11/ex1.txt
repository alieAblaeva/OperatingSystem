EXPLANATIONS:

Here we can see that the outputs of the same program run in different filesystem gives returns different outputs. This is because the program return files in the root directory, so the first time we run the program, we run it in the newly created loop file system and it only contains the files that we created and copied to there in ex1.sh. At the same time, the second time the ex1 program is run on the host file system and returns all files that are in its root directory
