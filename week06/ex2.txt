The change in the macro TRI_BASE in the worker process to a smaller number like 100 resulted in the worker generating numbers more frequently. However, the overall result of the scheduling didn't change. 
This indicates that the scheduling results were influenced more by the scheduling algorithm's logic and the process parameters (such as arrival time and burst time) rather than the specific behavior of the worker process. Therefore, adjusting the TRI_BASE macro in the worker did not have a direct impact on the scheduling decisions made by the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
